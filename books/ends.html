          <h3>Author: Colleen Hoover</h3>
          <h5>Genre: Contemporary Fiction, Romance, Drama</h5>
          <h5>Publication Date:  August 2, 2016</h5>
          <p>"It Ends with Us" by Colleen Hoover is a powerful and emotional contemporary romance novel that explores the complexities of love, relationships, and the impact of past traumas on the present. The story follows Lily Bloom, a young woman who has worked hard to create the life she wants. After growing up in a small town in Maine with a father who was abusive to her mother, Lily moves to Boston and starts her own business, a flower shop, to build a fresh start away from her painful memories.

            Lily's life takes a turn when she meets Ryle Kincaid, a charismatic and ambitious neurosurgeon. Ryle is handsome, confident, and appears to be the perfect man. As they get to know each other, Lily finds herself falling deeply in love with him. However, Ryle has a strict "no dating" rule due to his intense focus on his career, and he struggles with his own past and anger issues. Despite his commitment to remaining single, Ryle is drawn to Lily's warmth and resilience, and the two begin a passionate relationship.
            
            As Lily and Ryle's romance progresses, Lily's past starts to resurface in the form of Atlas Corrigan, her first love. Atlas was a homeless teenager Lily helped during her high school years, and their bond was strong and unbreakable, despite their eventual separation. When Atlas reappears in Lily's life, it forces her to confront her past and the unresolved feelings she still harbors for him. This reunion complicates her relationship with Ryle and brings back painful memories of her childhood.
            
            The novel takes a darker turn as Lily discovers that Ryle has a violent side, mirroring the abusive behavior she witnessed growing up. Lily is faced with a heartbreaking decision: whether to stay with Ryle, a man she loves despite his flaws, or to break the cycle of abuse she promised herself she would never repeat. Through Lily's internal struggle, the story delves into the difficult and often hidden reality of domestic violence, showing how love can be both beautiful and destructive.
            
            "It Ends with Us" is a deeply emotional and thought-provoking story that sheds light on the complexities of relationships and the courage it takes to make difficult choices. Colleen Hoover draws on her personal experiences to create a narrative that is raw, honest, and incredibly impactful. The novel emphasizes the importance of self-love, breaking free from toxic patterns, and finding the strength to put oneself first, even when it’s the hardest thing to do.</p>
